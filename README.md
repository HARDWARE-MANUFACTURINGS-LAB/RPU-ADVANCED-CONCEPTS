# RPU-ADVANCED-CONCEPTS

Therefore, a man should leave his parents and unite with his wife, so that the two of them can become one body.
(Genesis chapter  2...)
-----------------------------
RPU, the rust processing unit is the unit of the rust code to innate processable hardware. It is the secure cpu. Cause of the rust immediately run on it.
And, the Cache must be Bigger than traditional CPU.
It has the drop logics(voltage is drop to 0v, when the operantion done.
And, the natural-decimal numeric operation is available in this cpu.
Translate into binaries are next steps.

summarize: 

RPU has the 
1. Drop-logic gate
2. Borrowing and Lifetime checker and  Flags.
3. Error Bit Flags
4. control unit
5. Ownership checker  and  flags.
6. hardware-innate assembler(text mapper).
7. value ownership  tracker
8. Overflows  checker
9. DMA
10. Data  register
11. Opcode register
12. Data and Opcode classifier
13. Arithmetic  and  Logical  Unit
14. Accumulator
15. private space.
16. Result flags
    etc.


example  :
--------------------
***assembly  language  is  not  exist  on  the this  Processor(RPU).  Just  mapping  the truth  table  into  the  mux  and  demux , and  shift  register mocing  the  bits  to  mux . And  now, the  Operation  does.***
***notice***  : This solving  is  not the  only  truth.
